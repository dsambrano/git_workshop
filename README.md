# Leanring the Basics of Git and GitHub

This Repo is a companion for a post from my [blog][] where I taught a workshop on using git and GitHub.
You can access the [full series here][series].

Throughout the tutorials, you will learn how to create a git repo and connect it to GitHub.
You will learn about cloning repos and dealing with merge conflicts.
Later sections also describe how to work with branches and other advanced git features.
